# Simple-Discord-Bot
Simple discord bot with: custom prefix, command handler, and cooldowns!

Edit: Removed level system, seemed useless :p

## Instructions:
Step 1, Get a discord bot token from the discord developer portal <br>
Step 2, Go to config.json and paste the token in the "token" field <br>
Step 3, If on Glitch, your bot should instantly come alive <br>
Step 4, (If not on glitch) Go to the folder that the bot is in, and run: node index.js <br>
